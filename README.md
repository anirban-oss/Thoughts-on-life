# Thoughts-on-life
I breathe
I watch
I live this life 
for the sake of myself
and for the sake of others
I do not live for the sake of living in it.
I believe in overcoming obstacles and making your life worthwhile if you choose existence and embrace the power of life.
I love this life. Thank you for this existence.
